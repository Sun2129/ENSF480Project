# ENSF480Project

An online property management system with three types of users: Renters, Landlords, and Managers. 

Renters: Renters are split into two types of renters: registered renters and non-registered renters. Renters that are not registered are able to enter their search criteria and view properties that are posted by landlords that match their criteria. Subsequently, renters are able to e-mail landlords if they would like more information on the property or if they would like to rent the property. Registered renters have all of the functionality of non-registered renters, but are also given notifications everytime they login on properties that were posted since their last login that match their saved criteria.

Landlords: A landlord is able to register a new property and then pay to have it posted online for a certain period of time. They are also able to change the status of their properties from active to rented, suspended, or cancelled.

Managers: A manager is able to view all of the registered renters, landlords, and properties in the system. At the same time, they are also able to change the status of properties, change the fee that landlords have to pay to have their property posted, and change the amount of time that a property can be posted for after a landlord has paid for the property to be posted. Lastly, a manager is able to request a summary based off of a period provided by the manager. The summary returns the number of houses listed in the period, the number of houses rented in the last period,
